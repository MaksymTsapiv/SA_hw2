    "### How can you explain the distribution of c levels?\n",
    "After the initial setup the values are uniformly distributed from 0 to 1 as it was coded explicitly, but after 100 ticks distribution became normal because after only 100 ticks values that are high relative to neighbouring values are dragged down by this averaging process, while values low relative to neighbouring values are pulled up and that's why a lot of values happen to be somewhere in the middle, that is making normal distribution.\n",
    "\n",
    "### How it will evolve with time?\n",
    "Depending on the `w` c-values distributions were either somewhere in the middle between normal and uniform or converge to a uniform distribution very fast.\n",

    "### Can you estimate the final distribution?\n",
    "\n",
    "Local averaging provides a model of the uniform distribution because the averaging guarantees that the total $\\sum(c)$  across the whole model remains constant.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Now perform several simulations. Do you have another answer now?\n",
    "\n",
    "No, as I said before distribution should be uniform, and weight only changes the time how fast the model will converge to uniform distribution."
